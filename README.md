# arcgis_formatting
The reason to write this script is because when people try to create shapefile using arcgis, arcgis require the fields can only contain letters, numbers and underscore. So when people try to convert a file like csv file into shapefile, it is necessary to make sure the format is correct. Examples are as below:

Total Population -> Total_Population
"Total Population" -> Total_Population
Total Population: ->Total_Population
